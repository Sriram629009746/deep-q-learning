DQN Implementation for Lunar Lander using PyTorch

This project implements Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm using PyTorch to solve the OpenAI gym's Lunar Lander environment. The aim of the Lunar Lander environment is to land a spaceship on a landing pad while avoiding obstacles such as mountains and fuel depletion. The spaceship has four available actions: do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, and fire right orientation engine. The state of the environment is represented by a 8-dimensional vector.

The implementation is based on the original DQN paper by Mnih et al. (2015)[1].
